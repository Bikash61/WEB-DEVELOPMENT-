// Explain what happens when you add a string "10 " and a number 10 using the == operator 

let str = "10"
let num = 10 

isEqual = (str == num )
console.log(isEqual)

// It gives true when we use ==  operator , it just check the value 

// Explain the difference between == and === 

// The main difference between == and === is == just check the value of the varible, if the value is equal then it give sth etrue stattement but === at first check the value and then it also check the type when the type and value both will br equal then only === gives the true value
